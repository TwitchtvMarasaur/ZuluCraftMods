ZuluCraft Mod Packs

Download the Minecraft Forge version 14.23.4.2757 at https://files.minecraftforge.net/ (Click the +Show all files to find it)

Download the mods pack from here and place it in your.minecraft folder (on Windows type Win+R then %appdata% to find .minecraft); if you are not on Windows i'm not sure how to find it.

Make sure you select the right launcher for .2757 on your minecraft launcher

Connect to zulucraft.mchost.pro

Ask a mod for whitelist(give them your MC name)

Enjoy :~)
